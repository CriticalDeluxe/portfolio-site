## Process (step by step)

1. **Concept & constraints** : Pick a theme, define size limits, and decide what must read at miniature scale.
2. **Modeling** : Block out forms, refine silhouette, and prep clean geometry for printing.
3. **Test prints** : Print fast drafts to catch weak spots, overhang issues, and lost details.
4. **Iterate** : Adjust thickness, tolerances, and surfaces until results are consistent.
5. **Finish** : Remove supports, sand where needed, and prep the surface for paint/seal.
6. **Paint & seal** : Hand-paint details, then seal for durability and consistent sheen.
7. **Packaging** : Choose the presentation format and prep for shipping.
